# Objective
- To identify the geometric relationship between input and output motion parameters of PUMA 560 robot manipulator.
- Formation of the transformation matrix though which a relationship is established between different links of the manipulator.
- Simulate the robot motion for various inputs of the joint angular value.
- To have a brief idea about the workspace through a 3D graph plot of manipulator position for various inputs.
