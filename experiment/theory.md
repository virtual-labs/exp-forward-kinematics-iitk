#  Introduction

The PUMA 560 is a industrial robot arm with six degrees of freedom and all rotational joints. In this experiment at first a brief theory about PUMA 560 robot is presented in the theory section. The theory for mathematical computations was obtained from a wide variety of sources encompassing books, papers and internet. In simulation section a virtual model is developed in javascript program which is used to investigate the forward kinematics problem. For more information on other aspects of PUMA 560 and robotics visitors are advised to follow the references.
