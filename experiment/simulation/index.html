	<h1>Simulator</h1>
	<p>
This program simulates a 6 link 3D Puma Robot using the javascript program. The model and its movement of different links are encoded in javascript language. Model With this program the forward kinematics of PUMA 560 is explained, and simultaneously movements of different joints at a time can be seen. Axis coordinates and orientation are setup according to the theory explained earlier. This program does not allow for the specification of angular speed or acceleration of the arms. Click on the screenshot given below to start the simulation. <br>

Kinematics Panel consists of: <br>
